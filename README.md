Hello

This is a little project for one of my classes at UMD. 

We were tasked with finding an interesting dataset of our choice and performing 
exploratory data analysis and machine learning as a way to demonstarate what 
we've learned throughout the semester.

Here I've chose a dataset containing the stats data of all pokemon from the 
first 6 generations. I explain the game mechanics used by the pokemon games
and then try to find a trend in the the power levels of each type of pokemon
over the 6 generations.

Hope you enjoy!
